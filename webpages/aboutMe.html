    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Howdy and welcome to the page where you will hear all about me. I am a University of Rhode Island student graduating hopefully in 2023.<br>
      If its not apparent by the theme of this website I am a computer science major. In my free time I like to make music, play tennis, and longboard!
